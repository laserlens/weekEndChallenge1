# Weekend 1 challenge

Goal was to  us J-Query, html, and css to create an application.
The application allows the user to enter employee Data using text boxes.  It then calculates the total monthly salary of all employee Data.


## Notes of interest

*used css:
  - to create an animated submit button
  - to create a delete button that when hover over   turns green
  - when hover over table row highlights gray to guide users

*used J-Query:
  - if user enters no text in input fields highlights the boxes with no text red and stops the submit button from doing anything.
  - submit button on click puts the corresponding data into a table.
  - allows the deleting of table rows
  - calculates the total monthly salary as data is submitted to table then recalculates when data is deleted.
